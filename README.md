# YaMKernel
Yet Another MicroKernel is a MicroKernel written in Spark, a formally defined computer programming language based on the Ada. SparkOS is inspired by previous kernels and operating systems, such as SeL4 or Minx. The objective of this work is to design a safe implementation of a MicroKernel using Spark.
